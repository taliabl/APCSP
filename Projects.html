    <p>These are my projects. The first projectis my APCSP Performance task. This code was meant for people to be able to select a genre and price range, and then the code returns a book that meets their requirements. I completed this project when I submitted the code, a writing description of the code,and a video of the code working to college board. I learned a lot about how to code from this project.</p>

    <p> This second picture is a picture of a graph from one of my AP Biology labs. In this lab we were analyzing the CO2concentrations in different places. We were doing this to analyze acid trends in the world over time. We completed this project by submitting a lab report and analysis. I learned a lot about how to write a lab report from this project.
